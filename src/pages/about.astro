<Layout title="About Me">
    <p>
        With a background in Physics (B.Sc. and M.Sc.) and now studying Space Sciences and Technologies (M.Sc.), I've always been fascinated by how we can understand the 
        Universe - and build tools and systems to explore it! Alongside my studies, I gained hands-on experience in the space sector through internships and student jobs, 
        both in Germany and abroad.
    <p>
        Beyond that, I love turning ideas into working software. Whether it's an automation tool, a simulation for a research questions or web applications! I'm especially 
        interested in data science, machine learning and using technology to explore our complex world!
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time, you'll usually find me coding, doing sports, brewing coffee, or exploring something new - be it a new caf√© around the corner or this new bar in my 
        neighborhood.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few things I'm proud of, beyond my academic background, is having co-authored two scientific papers and contributed to an open-source Python library. But above all,
        I'm proud of being a curious and open-minded person - someone who can't resist taking things apart just to understand how they work.
    </p>
    <p> 
        My long-term goal? Pursue a PhD in the space field and work at a leading company or agency that's shaping the future of space exploration!
