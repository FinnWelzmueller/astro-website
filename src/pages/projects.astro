        A personal website built with Astro and Tailwind CSS, showcasing my projects and skills and advertizing my social media channels. It features a clean design and responsive layout, making it accessible on 
        various devices. The website you are currently viewing is the result of this project. The source code is not publicly available but I am happy to share it with you upon request.

        The follow-up of the FLexible Alert System for High Energy Sources from the European Space Agency. FLASHES2.0 features dedicated databases for timeseries, an automated 
        cron job system for the data download, dedicated software for data visualization, automated deployment with docker-compose, machine-learning-based alerting and tagging
        and much more! Dropped are the user management. Stay tuned!

        A straight-forward and interactive way to calculate potential Dark-Matter signals and gain spectral information from diffuse radio signals. The library is based on Python
        and can be installed via GitHub. It is designed to perform complex calculations in an efficient manner. The library is publibly available and was released in a peer-reviewed
        journal article.

        The FLexible Alert System for High Energy Sources (FLASHES) was a web application developed in the European Space Agency. The software downloaded data from three X-ray 
        All-Sky Monitors and visualized lightcurves and hardness ratios. Every X-ray source from the FLASHES catalogue was automatically analyzed and classified based on a 
        relevance. Relevant sources were advertised. For several predefined events, alerts were created and sent to the users via email. My tasks included the development of the 
        frontend and the alert system. The software was developed in Python and Angular and used a MongoDB database as data storage. Unfortunately, the project was discontinued 
        and offline since 2024.

        A set of Python scripts I developed for my Master's thesis in Physics at the Unviersity of Hamburg. The software builds a data pre-processing pipeline for the analysis
        radiodata from LOFAR and performs analyses for a set of processing parameters.
