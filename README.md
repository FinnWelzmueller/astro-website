# astro-website

Welcome! You found the code for my personal website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and Tailwind CSS. This is an ongoing project, so expect changes and updates over time. The project is hosted on [finnwelzmueller.online](finnwelzmueller.online). I use it mainly to showcase my work to potential employers but other projects are already in development. The website can be deployed via docker and is made to run behind a nginx reverse proxy.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Improve mobile user experience
- [ ] Add transitions with swup
- [ ] Correct color scheme in bright mode
- [ ] Fill index.astro with life
